# Generate workflow: Creates test artifacts and triggers the cleanup workflow.
# Used for manual testing of the delete-artifacts-action. Creates artifacts with
# various naming patterns to test different deletion strategies.
# NOTE: If there is a failure, cron.yml will delete weekly.
# This is to avoid filling up the repository with artifacts before the configured retention period.
